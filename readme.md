Originally an entry for Modjam 5, the Weeping Angels Mod introduces one of Doctor Who's most fearsome enemies.

The Weeping Angels are creatures from before time itself. Otherwise known as _The Lonely Assassins_, these creatures have evolved to possess the universe’s best self defence mechanism. When observed by any creature, the creature becomes quantum locked and is frozen in stone. Whilst some may call this a curse, one cannot kill a stone and a stone cannot kill you. But if you turn your back, even for just a second… it can.

_Of course, you can take a swing at stone with a pickaxe…_

**Recipes:**
Angel Painting:

**Features:**

-   The Angels will attempt to distinguish any light source around them. They currently destroy torches and turn off redstone lamps. _This can be toggled on and off with the “mobGriefing” gamerule._
-   Hands in the Snow. Angels have a chance of spawning in snow which is indicated with an arm emerging from the ground.
-   Angel Paintings can be crafted that have the chance of spawning a Weeping Angel.
-   When attacked the player has a 50/50 chance of being teleported randomly within the overworld.
-   Angel sickess (toggleable) - the player gets infected with wither potions ig they stare at the angel too long

**Planned Features:**

-   More poses for the angels
-   More variants of angels
-   Randomly generated structures for angels to spawn in
