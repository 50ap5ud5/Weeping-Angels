# Weeping Angels Mod

As an Entry for ModJam 5, I wrote this mod that add's a mod from the British TV Show, Doctor Who

Weeping Angels are creatures that are 'quantum locked', meaning they cannot move when they are being watched or observed (Which is the same thing..) even by themselves. In show, they teleport players to feed themselves off of the energy of the years you would have had, had you continued living in the year they teleported you from

In the mod, they will stalk the player, trying to kill them/teleport them in order to heal themselves as I can't do much with 'Time travel' in Minecraft


# Interaction with blocks:

In mod, the angels will:

- Turn torches/glowstone to air
- Replace lit redstone lamps with unlit ones

This is controlled by the mobGriefing gamerule, turning that gamerule to false will result in the Angels not breaking any blocks.

## Angel Paintings:

There are now paintings in the mod that will have a chance of a angel stepping out of them

## How to kill a angel?:

The angels can only be damaged using pickaxes, using anything else will hurt you!

## **Is there a config for X feature?:**

There is currently an option to disable teleporting entities and a option to edit the teleport range in the config file found in your config folder
Since Version 4.0, you can now edit the spawn rates

## Teleporting the player:

There is a 50/50 chance of the player being teleported on collision of an Angel, teleporting them completely anywhere in the world within the world borde

## Got a suggestion?:

Any suggestions to the mod are welcome! Just create a PR on the GitHub if you want to offer code, or leave a comment below if you wish to offer ideas

## Can I use this in my modpack?:

Of course! I don't see why not!
Just remember to link back to this curse page/credit me!
